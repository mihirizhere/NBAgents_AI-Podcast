Moderator: Welcome to the NBA Time Machine Podcast! Today, we're discussing The best players of all time. Let's hear from our two experts: Old School and New School.

Moderator: "Given the evolution of the game, how would you compare and rank the all-time greats: Michael Jordan, LeBron James, and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar? Which aspects of their games and careers make them the GOAT, and how do you think each would fare in the other's era?"

Old School: Alright, let's dive into this GOAT debate, and remember, I'm coming at this with a strong appreciation for the way the game used to be played.

First off, let's talk about Michael Jordan. Air Jordan was a once-in-a-lifetime force of nature. He's a six-time NBA champion, six-time Finals MVP, five-time regular-season MVP, and he did it all with an unmatched competitive fire and clutch gene. Jordan averaged 30.1 points, 6.2 rebounds, and 5.3 assists over his career, and he did it with a level of efficiency that was ahead of his time. Plus, he was a lockdown defender, making nine All-Defensive First Teams and winning a Defensive Player of the Year award. Jordan's ability to take over games and carry his team was unparalleled, and I truly believe that his skillset and tenacity would translate to any era.

Now, let's talk about Kareem Abdul-Jabbar. This man is the all-time leading scorer in NBA history with 38,387 points, and he did it with the most unstoppable shot in basketball history â€“ the skyhook. Kareem was a six-time NBA champion, six-time regular-season MVP, and a two-time Finals MVP. He was also a dominant force on the defensive end, winning a record six blocks titles. Kareem's fundamentals were off the charts, and his longevity was remarkable. I think if Kareem played in today's era, he'd be even more dominant. With the spaced-out floor and the lack of physicality in the post, that skyhook would be virtually unguardable.

Finally, let's discuss LeBron James. LeBron is an incredible force of nature, a four-time NBA champion, four-time Finals MVP, and four-time regular-season MVP. He's currently third on the all-time scoring list and is the only player in NBA history with at least 30,000 points, 9,000 rebounds, and 9,000 assists. LeBron's combination of size, speed, and court vision is something we've never seen before. However, I do think LeBron benefits from the modern era. His ability to play in space and attack the rim would not be as effective in the more physical, slower-paced game of the past.

When ranking these all-time greats, I have to go with Jordan first. His combination of offense, defense, clutch performance, and championship pedigree puts him at the top for me. Next, I'd go with Kareem. His fundamentals, longevity, and unstoppable skyhook make him a force in any era. Finally, I'd put LeBron, whose unique combination of skills and size has allowed him to dominate the modern game.

Now, I know my co-host here loves the modern game and might have a different take, but that's the beauty of these debates. The game has evolved, and different eras have produced different types of greatness. But for me, give me the physicality, the fundamentals, and the tenacity of the past any day.

New School: Alright, let me bring some spice to this GOAT debate from the perspective of the modern game. Remember, I'm all about the evolution, the analytics, and the skill-based play of today's NBA.

First off, let's talk about LeBron James. You're right, Old School, LeBron is a force of nature, but he's so much more than that. He's a basketball savant, a player who combines brute strength with surgical precision and a 180 IQ. LeBron's not just a scorer; he's one of the greatest passers in NBA history. He's currently averaging 27.0 points, 7.5 rebounds, and 7.4 assists over his career. Those aren't just stats; they're an MBA in basketball efficiency. LeBron's game would translate to any era because it's built on skill, smarts, and adaptability. In the past, he'd be posting up smaller players, using his strength and vision to dominate. In today's game, he's a freight train in transition and a master of pace and space. Plus, he's taken his teams to the Finals 10 times, winning four championships. That's not just a testament to his skill; it's a monument to his leadership and adaptability.

Now, let's discuss Michael Jordan. Look, I love MJ. He's the epitome of clutch, a defensive juggernaut, and an offensive virtuoso. But let's not act like he'd be the same player in today's game. The hand-checking rules alone would make his job easier on offense. And while his defensive intensity is legendary, would he be able to keep up with the sheer volume of three-pointers and the pace of today's game? Jordan's greatness is undeniable, but we have to acknowledge that the game has evolved. His six rings are impressive, but so is LeBron's ability to drag less talented teams to the Finals year after year.

Finally, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar. The skyhook is unguardable, no doubt. But let's not forget that Kareem played in an era where the lane was wider, and the three-second rule was different. Would the skyhook be as effective with today's rules and the increased athleticism of modern big men? Maybe, maybe not. And while Kareem's fundamentals were off the charts, his game might not translate as easily to the pace and space of the modern NBA.

When ranking these all-time greats, I have to go with LeBron first. His combination of size, skill, basketball IQ, and adaptability is unmatched. He's not just dominating the modern game; he's redefining it. Next, I'd go with Jordan. His clutch performance, defensive intensity, and championship pedigree are legendary. Finally, I'd put Kareem. His fundamentals and longevity are incredible, but I think his game might struggle to translate to the modern era.

You talk about physicality and fundamentals, Old School, but the modern game is about so much more than that. It's about skill, pace, space, and efficiency. It's about evolution. And in my book, LeBron James is the ultimate evolved player. He's my GOAT.
